# Interpreter
A work-in-progress interpreter where I attempt to build first a parser and then an interpreter for Pascal in Python.
Currently can parse binary expressions of arbitrary depth using arithmetic operators and integers only.

TODO:
* Add support for numbers with decimal points.
* Add bracketing to expressions without bracketing
* Extend binary operations to n-ary operations  EG. e1 + e2 +... + en
